# Ugly-Ducky
A USB Macropad I designed that was also used in Cybersecurity Club to show the dangerous potential of malicious USB devices like Hak5's Rubber Ducky( a usb flashdrive that tells a computer that it is a keyboard and mouse run foreign code/malware on an otherwise inaccessible computer). The Ugly Ducky mimics parts of a Rubber Ducky's but is ugly and cumbersome, making it ineffective as a malware delivery tool, but a great teaching tool.
